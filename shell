1)Write a shell script that will take the year as a input from the user and inform user whether it is a leap year or not. Display the output in the blinking text.(Hint: tput command)

Code:-#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter the year:"
read year

if [ $((year % 400)) -eq 0 ] || { [ $((year % 4)) -eq 0 ] && [ $((year % 100)) -ne 0 ]; }
then
    tput blink
    echo "$year is a Leap Year"
else
    tput blink
    echo "$year is NOT a Leap Year"
fi

tput sgr0

2)
Write a shell script that will take the name of a file from the user and check if the file is modified or not and display the message accordingly to the user. (Hint: use diff command. Check the exit status of the diff command)
Code:-#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter file name:"
read file

if [ ! -f "$file" ]; then
    echo "File does not exist"
    exit 1
fi

cp "$file" backup_file

echo "Modify the file now and press Enter"
read

diff "$file" backup_file

if [ $? -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "File is NOT modified"
else
    echo "File IS modified"
fi

rm backup_file
3)Write a shell script to generate the Fibonacci series up to a specified number. Take a number from the user and display the Fibonacci series upto this number. 
Code:-
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a number:"
read n

a=0
b=1

echo "Fibonacci series up to $n:"
while [ $a -le $n ]
do
    echo -n "$a "
    c=$((a + b))
    a=$b
    b=$c
done
echo
4)Write a shell script. Write 4 functions each for addition, subtraction, division and multiplication of 2 numbers. Ask user to enter 2 numbers. Also ask user the operation user wants to perform and then call the respective function and display the result. Use case statement. 
Code:-#!/bin/bash

add() {
    echo "Addition = $(( $1 + $2 ))"
}

sub() {
    echo "Subtraction = $(( $1 - $2 ))"
}

mul() {
    echo "Multiplication = $(( $1 * $2 ))"
}

div() {
    echo "Division = $(( $1 / $2 ))"
}

echo "Enter first number:"
read a
echo "Enter second number:"
read b
echo "Enter operation (add/sub/mul/div):"
read op

case $op in
    add) add $a $b ;;
    sub) sub $a $b ;;
    mul) mul $a $b ;;
    div) div $a $b ;;
    *) echo "Invalid operation" ;;
esac

5)Write the above script such that the script will not prompt user for anything. User will execute the script as shown below.

	./calc.sh      add    10    20    
OR           ./calc.sh     div     10    2
Code:-
#!/bin/bash

add() {
    echo "Result = $(( $1 + $2 ))"
}

sub() {
    echo "Result = $(( $1 - $2 ))"
}

mul() {
    echo "Result = $(( $1 * $2 ))"
}

div() {
    echo "Result = $(( $1 / $2 ))"
}

case $1 in
    add) add $2 $3 ;;
    sub) sub $2 $3 ;;
    mul) mul $2 $3 ;;
    div) div $2 $3 ;;
    *) echo "Usage: ./calc.sh add|sub|mul|div num1 num2" ;;
esac

6)Write the script that will take a number from the user and display whether the number is an odd or even number. Display the prompt in Red color. Display the output in Blue color and blinking text. 
Code:-
#!/bin/bash

tput setaf 1
echo "Enter a number:"
tput sgr0

read num

tput setaf 4
tput blink
if [ $((num % 2)) -eq 0 ]; then
    echo "Even Number"
else
    echo "Odd Number"
fi

tput sgr0
7)Write a shell script that will take a number from the user and display the square and square root of the number.  
Code:-
#!/bin/bash

echo "Enter a number:"
read num

square=$((num * num))
sqrt=$(echo "scale=2; sqrt($num)" | bc)

echo "Square = $square"
echo "Square Root = $sqrt"
